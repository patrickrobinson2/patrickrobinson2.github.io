<h2>Desktop POS System Newberry</h2>
<p>As your business grows ShopKeep's retail store software is designed to help you pivot with advanced features.

<p>ShopKeep also runs on Clover devices, such as Clover Station and Clover Mini Though it doesn't include as many industry-specific features as some other systems, ShopKeep has an affordable price point (monthly rates are customized for each business) and has a lot to offer in the areas of inventory and employee management. It allows businesses to boost service quality while offering data reporting and order tracking capabilities.</p>

<p>Good retail management software should print barcode labels in two sizes and can automatically print a label for every item in the last shipment. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entr√©e or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
