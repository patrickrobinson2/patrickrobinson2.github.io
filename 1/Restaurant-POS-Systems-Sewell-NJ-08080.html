Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business.

<p>Franchise bar and grills are the most up to date on computerized menu systems and are able to turnaround tables much faster than years ago, increasing sales. The right POS system can make your life easier — and improve the experience for your customers — while the wrong one can really set you back.

As you evaluate POS systems, you need to look at the costs, terms and features for each part of the system: software, hardware and payment processing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software.

<p>Mobile POS systems are always less expensive, especially if you already own tablets. To be completely accurate, we can say that POS refers to the hardware and software which cashiers use for checkouts. Identifying your customers is even faster with loyalty cards and customer barcode ids. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>
