To evolve into a valuable component of Retail 4.0, POS systems will need IoT connectivity.

It automatically updates the essential database from customers, products, inventory, sales, loyalty programs and labor. Cashier Live's software help businesses ring up sales with ease, as well as tracking inventory, managing staff, accessing data and generating reports.</p>
