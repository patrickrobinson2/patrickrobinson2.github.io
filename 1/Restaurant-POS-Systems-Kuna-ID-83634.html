<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

With today's modernized POS systems for bars, creating an engaging loyalty program that customers want to participate in is easy. For example, restaurants, retail businesses, and grocery stores all have their specialties and that is why they need a POS system that meets their specific needs.</p>

Pose is a cloud-based POS system that can be used by stores, cafes, booths, salons and service providers working on location. Saving costs and increasing profits is vital and many software companies position themselves to provide Point of Sale Software that forces you into expensive service agreements and fees.</p>
<p>Industry experts recommend buying POS hardware; leases often come with lengthy, noncancelable contracts and specific card processing requirements that cost you more money over time. Thus, every restaurateur must look for the below-mentioned features when choosing a reliable restaurant management software to manage operations, employees and in turn, increase sales. Most POS systems for bars and restaurants will have this feature.</p>

Today's point-of-sale software contains many more features in addition to the computerized cash register. While the features above are important to consider when picking out a POS for your restaurant, you should go beyond just the features.</p>
<p>For enhanced customer satisfaction in your business, the system makes it relatively easy for you to void or comp customer checks. In simple terms, Point of Sale serves as a system that allows the sale of physical goods in a retail store. Bars thrive on their ability to serve customers quickly and on the go. Their self-service option makes it possible for customers to order directly from an iPad at their table which cuts down on wait-times and increases sales.</p>
<p>Smaller retailers are moving away from these traditional POS systems and toward cloud based point of sale solutions. Lightspeed POS' inventory management options are unmatched by its competitors. IVend POS also helps combat in-store fraud by assigning access rights per salesperson with security, Biometric login, as well as to management of data access restrictions with password, and automatic alerts on suspicious behaviors.</p>

<p>A single POS terminal may be enough for small and new businesses, but you may want to add more if your business is busy and you need to reduce wait times. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants. Bar inventory management systems can help measure every ounce of alcohol that flows through a premise, every minute, every day.</p>

<p>The Premium plan allows you to connect with additional business tools, including the ability to link in-store sales with ecommerce platforms. Apps designed to keep repeat business with customers and features like scan to pay, skip the line and rewards. The benefit of this is that it allows the programs to share sales figures and customer contact information, saving you the hassle of manually downloading it from one program and uploading it to the other.</p>
<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city. There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>
