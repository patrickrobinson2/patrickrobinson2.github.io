As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner. Vend is EMV and NFC capable and integrates with Vantiv , PayPal , and Square for in-store credit card payments. A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service.
