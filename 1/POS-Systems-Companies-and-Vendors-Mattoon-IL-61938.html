<h3>Online Restaurant POS System Mattoon Illinois</h3>
<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>Good retail management software should print barcode labels in two sizes and can automatically print a label for every item in the last shipment. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entr√©e or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
