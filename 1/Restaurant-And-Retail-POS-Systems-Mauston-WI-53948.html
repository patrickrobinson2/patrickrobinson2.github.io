<h3>Retail Systems Inc. Point Of Sale Systems Mauston Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. Because traditional point of sale systems require you to run reports from an in-store terminal, your ability to make data-driven business decisions is limited to when you're at your business location. Vend enables ease of sale, regardless of whether retailers use Vend's responsive web-based POS on PC, Mac or the Vend Register iPad app.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable.
