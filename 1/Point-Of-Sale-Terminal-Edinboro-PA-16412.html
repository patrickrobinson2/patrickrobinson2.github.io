<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost. Besides accepting credit and debit cards and cash, restaurants must accept gift cards and mobile payments to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Inventory management is the process of controlling costs and waste through effective use of on-hand product. Epos Now is an award-winning POS system trusted by hospitality businesses like Best Western Hotels and Subway Restaurants. With a solid POS retail system, it will be easy to correlate that person or persons work schedule with the minute-to-minute sales information.
