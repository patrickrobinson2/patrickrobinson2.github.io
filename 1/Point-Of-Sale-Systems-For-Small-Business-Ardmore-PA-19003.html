<h3>The Benefits Of Point Of Sale Systems Are Becoming More Apparent Ardmore Pennsylvania</h3>

POS System Maintenance: Things in a restaurant are prone to get greasy, have food spilled on them and get dirty quickly.

<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
