<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Transactions, replacing the cash registers with a Point-Of-Sale (POS) system save you money. For multiple terminals, additional PC server will be needed to consolidate all sales data and provide more sophisticate reporting to management. This POS system boasts special features for retailers operating hardware stores, pharmacies and boutiques.
