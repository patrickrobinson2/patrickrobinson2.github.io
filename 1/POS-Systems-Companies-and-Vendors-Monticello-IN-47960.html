<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Start using Hike POS software with a 14-day free trial and get it ready for retail in 3 easy steps. In addition to checking out customers and recording sales data, it becomes the hub of your business, bringing together information about your sales, inventory, customers, and employees, so you can manage your business more efficiently.

You can close out or reconcile your cash drawer at any time and even have multiple shifts and multiple point of sale operators per shift. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server.</p>
<p>ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory. Most retailers need an end-to-end retail management solution that provides them with centralized control and a real-time view of their operations for faster decision-making.
