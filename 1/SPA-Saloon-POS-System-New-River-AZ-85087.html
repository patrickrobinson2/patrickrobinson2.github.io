<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. To evolve into a valuable component of Retail 4.0, POS systems will need IoT connectivity. As the most popular mobile card reader company in the UK, this app is widely used by small shops who do not need very advanced features at their point of sale. It automatically updates the essential database from customers, products, inventory, sales, loyalty programs and labor. Cashier Live's software help businesses ring up sales with ease, as well as tracking inventory, managing staff, accessing data and generating reports.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>

POS terminal serves as the physical equipment that allows merchants to process payments to complete a customer purchase. With a point of sale system at your restaurant, you're able to track kitchen performance and order times.</p>
<p>Most restaurant POS vendors, however, supply hardware as well as software. A retail management software offers managers to keep track of performance, sale volume and more even when they are not on the floor. Traditionally, the restaurant POS system is where a customer makes a payment in exchange for goods or services. At the heart of Bluestore Live is an admin console, in which a business's data is securely stored on BlueStore's servers living in the cloud or the company's own private URL.</p>
