This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards. OPUS automatically updates the sale and stock of the POS back to the retail ERP running at the head office. These applications would typically provide the same core functions, so watch out for other things like the hardware you would need to purchase on top of the software or which mobile platform it runs on.
