Some restaurant POS systems offer these features as an integrated part of their system, but many do not. With CRM integration, the Point Of Sale software for restaurants can acquire customer feedback, analyze and generate reports based on customer behavior. If all you need is to have a total amount of cash in the drawer that sometimes matches to the amount of sales shown you probably don't need a point of sale system.</p>

Menu building — Building a menu can be a complex endeavor, but restaurant POS systems allow you to see your inventory and build a menu that's appropriate.
