<p>Learn what features to look for when choosing the best retail POS system for your company. ChronitoPOS makes customer relationship management easy. Reprint this ticket 10 times and sell and collect for themselves these reprinted receipts instead of ringing up new customers. The software lets you stay on top of purchase orders, keep tabs on vendor orders by product, organize multiple vendors in one place, as well as run reports to instantly see your best sellers, total sales, and total taxes. Toast itself acts as the client's payment processor, and unlike many of its iOS-based competitors in the POS world, runs on Android operating systems, making it at once cheaper and more versatile.</p>

<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>
