<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
<h2>Best POS Systems For Bars Elkview</h2>
<p>This is due to the vast range of payment modes accepted by POS.A POS allows payment through Card, Cash, Gift Cards. It has various POS solutions tailored to how your business operates: Station for speed, Mini for a full POS that comes in a small size, Flex for processing payments beyond the counter and settle for an on-the-go swiping and tapping of payments using a mobile device.

<p>Point of sale equipment allows faster payment service thereby reducing the amount of time a shopper has to wait to pay for their items. The cost of the POS software depends on the business size, amount of features it offers, quality of elements, type of industry POS system is meant for, and potential for expansion. SalesVu POS takes a different approach to most POS providers. Retail stores require different types of POS equipment.</p>
<p>The user purchases the POS system with hardware and accessories such as to monitor screen, cash register, barcode scanner, receipt printer, and card readers. Many restaurant owners are familiar with POS systems because basic versions are usually included in retail or restaurant packages Restaurant systems are normally equipped with a terminal, a touch-screen monitor, and a cash drawer. The pos software should be in compliance with the data security standards, which is recognized by the Payment Card Industry (PCI).</p>
