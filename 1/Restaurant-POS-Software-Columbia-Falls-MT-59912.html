<p>The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. Splitting the bill across multiple credit cards is a common occurrence at restaurants and bars. Loyalty: Loyalty can be a great way to increase profits for your business by giving customers a reason to frequent your store again.
