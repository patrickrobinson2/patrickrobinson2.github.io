Identifying your customers is even faster with loyalty cards and customer barcode ids. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>

<p>For a bar POS system, you will need to either purchase or lease your hardware components, though industry experts recommend avoiding leasing, as contracts are lengthy and noncancelable.

Today, with the help of a retail POS software you can simplify your billing, promotions, returns and much more.</p>
<p>Harbortouch TablesideTM allows your restaurant's servers to input customer orders directly from the table via an Apple® iPad® for a dramatic increase in speed, service quality, and efficiency.
