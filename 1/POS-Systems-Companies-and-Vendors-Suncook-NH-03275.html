<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>

And while the software half of the POS system equation is probably most important, especially in a cloud-based solution, many retail businesses will still require a hardware half.</p>
<p>The point” of sale payment is when a customer and merchant exchange products or services completing a POS transaction aka point of sale purchase. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone.

Credit card processing rates through Lightspeed Payments are set at a predictable fee for all card types, including American Express: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction (2.6% + $0.30 card not present). When your sales staff enter the customers' name, they can quickly call up their entire purchase history and their email address.</p>
<p>Another significant advantage of using a restaurant management software is the ability to send orders directly to the kitchen - this is a considerable advantage by increasing food prep time, staff efficiency, and reducing errors in the kitchen. Offer better, quicker and more engaging service in total flexibility having any number of POS devices, no matter if stationary or mobile, to connect at the same time.</p>
<p>A big portion of these business owners are afraid of investing the time and money in a POS system to only end up regretting it because it just didn't work as they had hoped for.
