A POS system has features that support the rationalization of a small or large retail business's day to day operations.

<p>Wasp QuickStore options range from complete POS single store systems to multi-store. The inventory management module embedded in Lightspeed allows the business personnel to carry out their day to day activities in a highly organized manner. For multi-channel retailers who sell online and in physical spaces, applications like Shopify POS and Vend meet the above criteria.

<p>Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is leading the IoT revolution in retail systems, allowing for end-to-end inventory control, smooth tracking of goods through purchase, and eliminating the need for barcode scanners at the register.

<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system.
