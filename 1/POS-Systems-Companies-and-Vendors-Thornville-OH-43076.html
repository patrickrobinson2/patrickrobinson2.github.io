<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>
<p>A functioning POS gift card program can also help retain customers. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more.

<p>Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table. You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
