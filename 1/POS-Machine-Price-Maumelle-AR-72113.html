<p>Now, customers can walk into a bar and grill having already placed their order before they left the office. You may think of point-of-sale (PoS) systems as just ordinary cash registers, but they're evolving to do much more. Chris Ligan, vice president of acquisitions at credit card processing company Auric , listed a few must-haves that every business, bar or otherwise, should look for in a POS system. Small businesses can take advantage of simple credit card processing, which is integrated with Quickbooks and encrypted for the protection of the business and its customers' data.</p>
