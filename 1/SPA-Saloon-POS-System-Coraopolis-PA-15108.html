<p>Point-of-sale systems, as a result, are basically cash registers on steroids.” POS software expanded the basics of the cash register directly into credit card payment processors and back-end accounting.

POS software is the program that runs on the hardware. Restaurant Software connects to the best business apps in accounting, ecommerce, staff rostering and more.</p>
