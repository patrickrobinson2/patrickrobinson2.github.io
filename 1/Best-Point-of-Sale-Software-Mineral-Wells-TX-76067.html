Point-of-sale systems, or POS, are the retail software and hardware merchants use to process in-person transactions.

Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.</p>

To maintain operational efficiency and effectiveness, restaurant owners have started using robust restaurant management software.
