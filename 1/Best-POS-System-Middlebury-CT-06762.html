The system comes with free downloadable software plus a Square magstripe reader, enabling payments via debit and credit cards.</p>
<p>Manage Specials - POS systems automate the process of tracking current and marked down pricing. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it.

Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them. Note that these fees are determined by the payment processor, not by the POS provider (although sometimes the POS provider will make you use their in-house payment processor).
