<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>

<p>User-friendly - The point of sale software should be easy to use so that you can manage it comfortably without consulting the manual regularly or depending on the tech support all the time. Dinerware is a Microsoft-based point-of-sale system that was founded in 2000 and acquired by Heartland Payment Systems in 2015. Retail POS demands a high level of testing keeping in mind that its performance and correct functioning directly affect business revenues.</p>

<p>Free POS Software can be used as a replacement to similar third-party versions employed in common retail establishments. Credit card processing rates through Lightspeed Payments are set at a predictable fee for all card types, including American Express: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction (2.6% + $0.30 card not present).

<p>The application is designed for ease of use, so you don't need vast technical background to navigate through the application and start processing sales orders, payments, and shipping. On-Premise - There are broad ranges of features in on-premise modules, and it is difficult and time-consuming to add new functionalities in this POS solution. If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise.</p>
<p>The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.
