<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>You get three software versions to choose from - Basic, Pro, and Multi-Store, all designed to help you ring sales, take payments, track customer data, and generate reports. Lastly, today's liquor POS software makes it easy to track individual ingredients , so you know exactly how many drinks, appetizers and other products you can offer guests before you're out of stock. Additionally, remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data.</p>
