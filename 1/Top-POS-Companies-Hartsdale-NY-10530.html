<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>
