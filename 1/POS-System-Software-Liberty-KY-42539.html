<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure. NCR is a longtime provider of banking services, software, and hardware with experience at handling all areas of tablet POS. For retail businesses, inventory is carefully monitored and set to automatically replenish diminished inventory. The cloud-based Zomato Book POS provides a single platform restaurant operations management. POS Software is a computerized retail management system that takes advantage of the latest touch screen and scanning technologies, facilitating the rapid transaction processing necessary in a fast-paced retail environment.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises.

It provides recipe management and food costing, purchase management, stock management and inventory, along with a powerful reporting capability.</p>
<p>You can also build visually stunning online stores with highly-customizable themes. Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them.
