<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges. Most of you are familiar with point of sale (POS) systems, even if you don't realize it. Remote access: Some POS systems can act as bar and restaurant management software, allowing managers to view sales figures, stock data and much more, remotely. Whether you're serving drinks at happy hour, serving customers a quick meal or brewing up the latest imported coffee bean, eHopper is made for multiple types of small businesses.</p>
