<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>
<h2>Best Retail POS Software Bad Axe</h2>
<p>As your business grows ShopKeep's retail store software is designed to help you pivot with advanced features. But I had breakfast with a group of retailers and I asked them what kind of retail software point of sale (POS) systems they were using.
