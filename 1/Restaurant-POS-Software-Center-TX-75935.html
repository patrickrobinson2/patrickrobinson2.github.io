<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Clover is an all-in-one point-of-sale and payment system for restaurants that integrates the functions of a cash register, card payment terminal, and POS system. With today's modernized POS systems for bars, creating an engaging loyalty program that customers want to participate in is easy.

<p>It is suggested that you must install Credit card readers at your business point. Simply POS enables retailers to take the full control of their business, even without being present in-store. By using an API-led approach to connectivity, Buffalo Wild Wings was able to integrate their POS system to not one, but three systems--creating a unique solution that provides their restaurant chains with unprecedented visibility into their beer inventory.</p>
