<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets.

<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>
