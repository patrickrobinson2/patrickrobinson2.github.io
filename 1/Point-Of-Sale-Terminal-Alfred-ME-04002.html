<h3>Managing Your Restaurant Inventory Wisely Alfred Maine</h3>
<p>You have access to features like table management, delivery, and cash management. POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry. Entry level systems begin at around $500 for the hardware and a monthly subscription price for the software of about $50. The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management.</p>

You can use it to take orders tableside, track inventory at the ingredient level, manage customers, offer loyalty promotions and generate reports. With POS systems that offer this feature, you'll be able to track transaction history, take notes, and potentially even contact customers, all through your point of sale. This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the US and Canada.</p>
