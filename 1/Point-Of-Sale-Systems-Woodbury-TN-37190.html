<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment â€”a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>ARBA's point of sale systems serves industries across the board, from retail, cafeterias , bookstores , gift shops, pet stores , restaurants and to healthcare. Once a sale is entered, these systems automatically update inventory and accounts receivable records. That's where a point of sale system comes in.

It is important to anticipate your business growth and choose a bar POS system that will allow you to expand as you see fit. As a result of such extreme competitive pressures, modern POS has evolved far beyond a payment and accounting system to become not just point of sale, but also point of service, driving highly individualized interactions that consistently gratify customers in the moment.</p>

If your vision calls for an integrated retail management solution that delivers an exceptional user and customer experience, you've come to the right place. As mentioned above, locally-installed systems can only be accessed at the physical location of the servers whereas, with a cloud-based system, you could theoretically keep an eye on your sales on a beach in Hawaii if you felt the urge.</p>
