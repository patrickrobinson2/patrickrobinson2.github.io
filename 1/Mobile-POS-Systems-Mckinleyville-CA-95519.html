<p>Agiliron is redefining retail point of sale. The system is accompanied by powerful hardware, including credit card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and label printers, to name a few. A POS system can increase profits by providing a quick and reliable check-out process, maintain detailed sales and inventory reports, and provide integrated profit increasing programs such as loyalty programs, coupons, and special discount programs.</p>

Once the inventory code is entered, the systems call up the standard or sales price, compute the price at multiple quantities and provide a running total. To find the best POS systems for small businesses, we asked small business owners which systems they use and what they like and dislike about them.</p>
<p>The components of a POS system include hardware, software and operational features. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors. POS software or POS systems are located wherever a transaction occurs, which generally tends to mean the terminal that is used for checkouts.</p>

<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
