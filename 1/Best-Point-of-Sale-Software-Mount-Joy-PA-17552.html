<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. A good place to start is with your inventory management system provider. Take deposits and partial payments on layaway sales, or let your customers pay on account. This POS software is acclaimed as an easy to use, powerful, and intuitive platform that enables small and midsized businesses to manage single or multi-location stores with total ease.

In addition to checking out customers and recording sales data, it becomes the hub of your business, bringing together information about your sales, inventory, customers, and employees, so you can manage your business more efficiently. BarTab's traditional POS system offers integration with your accounting software, cash control features, and customer loyalty programs.</p>

Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management. It is wise to use the POS computer for only sales transactions, reports, and inventory control, and isolate use of POS computers from general purpose activities.</p>

POS software is often implemented along with other restaurant management systems like staffing management, inventory management, and finance platforms.
