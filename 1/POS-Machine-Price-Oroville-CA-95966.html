EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip.</p>
<p>My previous experience was also in e-commerce, so I'd seen the first-hand benefits that retail technology could have when it came to time savings and sales insights. Menu building — Building a menu can be a complex endeavor, but restaurant POS systems allow you to see your inventory and build a menu that's appropriate.

<p>POS software, in tandem with some kind of hardware, allows you to process all of these types of transactions. The orders taken from the customers are forwarded to the staff working in the kitchen. But, all in all, small retail businesses, coffee shops, and general restaurants make up the bulk of ShopKeep's user base, which stretches beyond 23,000.
