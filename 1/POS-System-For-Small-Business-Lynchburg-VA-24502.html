<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>ARBA's point of sale systems serves industries across the board, from retail, cafeterias , bookstores , gift shops, pet stores , restaurants and to healthcare. Once a sale is entered, these systems automatically update inventory and accounts receivable records. That's where a point of sale system comes in. A point of sale system helps to make everything from inputting orders to inventory and even taking payment more streamlined.</p>
