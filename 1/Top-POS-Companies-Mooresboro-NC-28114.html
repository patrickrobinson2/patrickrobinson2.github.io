<p>Payment by check has historically offered an opportunity for fraud and lost revenues, but modern point of sale systems have introduced security tools to help minimize this possibility. Integrated employee time card systems schedule hours and generate payroll, and the inventory is intelligent and self-managing (set the items just one time and the inventory tracks and manages them from there on out, sending key alerts when items need to be reordered, and even printing order forms for vendors).</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers. But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>
