<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>All of the systems are EMV-compliant These POS systems also support NFC (near-field communication) technology, which enables contactless payments through mobile wallets such as Apple Pay.

<p>Orders can be taken tableside and are sent directly from the waiting staff to the kitchen - meaning staff no longer have to wait for an open terminal to complete the order which cuts down the time between customers ordering and receiving their food. With Smart Tax the customer pays the sales tax on bar sales with food items. Since 2008, ShopKeep has been helping quick-service restaurants with their management needs.</p>
