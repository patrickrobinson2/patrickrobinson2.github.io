<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>
