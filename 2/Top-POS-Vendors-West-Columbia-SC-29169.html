<p>Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough. By integrating your POS system with the ERP system, Business Central , you avoid entering the same data in multiple systems as all transactions are posted automatically. A proper POS system can streamline your retail outlet & saves time, a flawed one can complicate even the little things, thus making the process of checkout frustrating for anyone at the payment counter.</p>

Inventory management for restaurants is absolutely essential.
