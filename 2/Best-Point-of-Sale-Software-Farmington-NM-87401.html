With regards to databases, POS systems are very demanding on their performance because of numerous submissions and retrievals of data - required for correct sequencing the receipt number, checking up on various discounts, membership, calculating subtotal, so forth - just to process a single sale transaction.

You can also run email marketing, customer loyalty plans, and gift card programs from Square's point-of-sale software.
