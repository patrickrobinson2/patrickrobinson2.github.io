<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
