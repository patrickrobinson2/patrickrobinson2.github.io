<p>The sole purpose of any Point of Sale System setup by any store is to improve sales and profits by keeping track of all the products being sold or purchased at the retail store. You can close out or reconcile your cash drawer at any time and even have multiple shifts and multiple point of sale operators per shift. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
