Our retail team would come to us with a bottleneck in the process, and we would create customizations in Retail Pro to fix it. We're always finding new ways to increase efficiency in our stores. The retailers can bring incentives, cross-sell, interact with shoppers, and up-sell by swiping a loyalty card.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
