<p>AccuPOS Point of Sale creates a fast and simple solution for your restaurant and retail environments. Restaurants - Having an electronic point of sale machine in your restaurant can help you to offer better customer service by giving your service staff more time looking after your customers rather than running around with order cards. Multiple-Terminal Plans and Enterprise Plans - These two categories are reserved for large restaurant businesses and they come with Single Lavu Terminal functionalities plus enterprise-level support, global menu push, customized regional reporting, plus franchises and chains features.</p>

For example, department stores often have POSs for individual product groups, such as appliances, electronics, and apparel.</p>
<p>A few services, such as Square Point of Sale, offer POS services for free, as long as you process your payments through them. Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.
