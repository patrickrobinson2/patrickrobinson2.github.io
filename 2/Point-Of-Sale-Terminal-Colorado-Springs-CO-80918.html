<p>Grow with an all-in-one solution for financial management, inventory, reporting, and customer service. We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Your bar customer is paying the same amount as a customer in the restaurant. Both our POS apps offer a fast checkout, daily sales reports, seamless accounting integration and smart stock management. The Lightspeed Point of Sale system is also listed among the top POS systems with its amazing set of features and high-level performance.</p>
<p>TouchBistro restaurant POS system doesn't come with purchase-ordering and vendor management capabilities. Lavu utilizes advanced restaurant hardware and technology that include self-serve kiosks and digital menu boards, which make transacting and order taking quicker and more convenient.
