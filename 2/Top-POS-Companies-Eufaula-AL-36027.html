<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running. The smart restaurant POS software also allows you to split guest bills by food type and quantity. Mobile payments - In business, mobile payment options have made the transactions more accessible and safer and can even improve customer service.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information. Managers can also keep track of profits, inventory, menu trends, and other analytics. And if you want to do business online as well as in person, some POS systems offer the ability to create an online store that will pull from the same inventory database as your brick-and-mortar store.</p>
<h2>QuickBooks Point Of Sale Eufaula</h2>
<p>We use livepos and this helps in simplifying our sales report every day and its accurate compared to the old fashioned cash registers. The best rated free POS systems for restaurants, bars, nightclubs, retail stores, small business, salons, and spas. Times have changed, and now the technology to record transactions and make sales may be small enough to fit into the palm of your hand. Scanning the bar code at the Point of Sale rather than typing an SKU virtually eliminates errors in pricing and inventory.</p>
<p>Cross Channel returns management- The POS returns management system accepts the cross-channel returns and assists in refunds along with replacements from any type of store location. More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>And many POS systems are capable of accepting almost any type of payment, including contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay. That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>

<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe. Continue selling even when the internet goes down, Your Restaurant Software will automatically re-sync sales when online. Receipt printer: Used to print receipts for customers or end-of-day reports for cashing up.</p>
<p>You may only need a simple system to complete business transactions, or you may require a full-service option that also monitors inventory, tracks employee tips and integrates with other applications.

<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
