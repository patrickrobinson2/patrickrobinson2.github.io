<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost. Besides accepting credit and debit cards and cash, restaurants must accept gift cards and mobile payments to stay competitive.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
