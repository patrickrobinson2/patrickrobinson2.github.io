<p>Increase your flexibility and satisfy your customers by accepting multiple types of payment. Needless to say, any Retail POS System will be able to receive and manage payments. That's the kind of omnichannel retail experience that customers have grown to expect.

<h2>Small POS System Johnson City NY</h2>
<p>ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas. That's because most of the mobile small business systems are designed to be light, flexible, and cost-effective. Some point of sale systems only accept online payments. The software in some systems runs only for a limited period of time.</p>
<p>The basic purpose of a restaurant POS system is to facilitate orders and accept payment from customers. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. When you have enough personnel on the sales floor and at the cash wrap, shoppers intuitively get the message that they are worth your time and staff investment. Track customers' buying behaviors and create targeted marketing campaigns to retain current customers and win new business.</p>
<p>Smaller retailers are moving away from these traditional POS systems and toward cloud based point of sale solutions. Lightspeed POS' inventory management options are unmatched by its competitors.
