<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. For a store that generates annual sales, the savings can be significant by utilising a POS system. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Omnichannel by design: Manhattan POS is equipped with all of the capabilities needed to turn stores into the center of your omnichannel experience: omni cart, omni fulfillment, returns, exchanges, cross-channel promotions, complete customer transaction and interaction history across channels, and more.</p>
<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores. The Lavu Restaurant Point-of-Sale Station Kit costs $850 and it comes with an Epson M30 receipt printer, an iDynamo credit card reader, a cash drawer, and an iPad. Data collection and analytics - The POS system collects customer details along with data and tax information. Its mobile implementation is equally capable with a one-touch payment feature to support a responsive build and superior micro-moments technology to drive your brand and actual growth of sales.</p>

<p>Staff would fetch items for customers to prevent the opportunity for theft and sales would be made at the same counter. Check out our reviews of the 10 best PoS systems to see how they stack up when faced with the tasks of businesses today. Technological innovations and third-party integrations have made the POS pretty much the only software that is needed to run a restaurant successfully. Simple card swipers are affordable and sometimes thrown in for free with the purchase of a POS system.</p>
<p>To give you a better understanding of these systems, we will present to you the 15 best POS software currently in the market. Ambur is an iPad POS system for restaurants that also works on the iPhone and iPod Touch. It's predicted that eighty percent of all enterprise (and mission-critical) workloads will move to the cloud by 2025 ( Top 10 Cloud Predictions ). To this end, many retailers are seeking a cloud-based strategy to meet employee and customer needs.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet. We're not the best fit for everyone, and if our retail point of sale won't meet the needs of your retail business, we'll be the first to tell you.</p>

<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.
