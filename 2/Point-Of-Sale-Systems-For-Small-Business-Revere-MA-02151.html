<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Technological advances such as point of sale systems, email ordering and computerized kitchens have taken fast service to a new level. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. ShopKeep can be used for payment processing, inventory management, transactions, customer marketing, staff management, reporting and analytics, and more.</p>
<p>Clover is an all-in-one point-of-sale and payment system for restaurants that integrates the functions of a cash register, card payment terminal, and POS system. With today's modernized POS systems for bars, creating an engaging loyalty program that customers want to participate in is easy. For example, restaurants, retail businesses, and grocery stores all have their specialties and that is why they need a POS system that meets their specific needs.</p>
