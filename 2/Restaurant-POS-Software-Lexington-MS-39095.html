<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up. Your point of sale should help you automate and optimize how you manage your business's inventory. Give your bartenders possibility to quickly and accurately serve customers and create a unique atmosphere for your bar. So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually.</p>
<p>Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. For a while, on-site POS software has been the norm for computerised POS systems , but it is now more common to use cloud-based or hybrid systems relying on both the internet and local hosting. We've been assisting and simplifying the daily routine of retail businesses since 2001.</p>

Point of sale (POS), a critical piece of a point of purchase , refers to the place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable.</p>
