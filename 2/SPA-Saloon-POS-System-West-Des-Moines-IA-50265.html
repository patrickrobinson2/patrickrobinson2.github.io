<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Springboard is a powerful, cloud-based POS software and management system for retailers. Having actual connected data means your sales associate can save the sale by placing an order to the other store using send sale capabilities. There are hundreds of companies that exist only to provide their bar and restaurant software to you. In addition to Square's standard credit card processing capabilities, the restaurant POS system can also accept Google Pay and Apple Pay, even in the middle of an internet service outage.</p>
