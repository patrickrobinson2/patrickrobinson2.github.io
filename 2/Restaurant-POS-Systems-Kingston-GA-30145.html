<p>It is a must in retail stores earning revenue above $7, 00,000. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device. While a cash register only stores money and is often attached to a computer or bar code scanner a point of sale or POS does this all in one interface.</p>
<p>Inventory isn't a favorite topic among managers, but it's a top necessity for being ahead in a highly competitive business. A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur. Key features include floor management, customer and inventory tracking, table-side ordering and an offline mode.
