<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>With restaurant POS software, that can all be done using the tool. The point is to start with a checklist for evaluating restaurant POS systems. In addition to POS capabilities, it also comes with a Dine-In module to simplify table management, CRM, home delivery management, and live business dashboard.
