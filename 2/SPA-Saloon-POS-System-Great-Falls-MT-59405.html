<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>The system features automatic invoicing, barcode scanning, debit card PIN processing and digital receipts. A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software.

Another function of this mPOS is its connectivity to our Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Head Office (HO) software system.</p>
<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>

Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
