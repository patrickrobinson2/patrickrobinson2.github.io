<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>

It is a comprehensive tool equipped with features ranging from order management and payment processing to CRM and loyalty program management. Point-of-sale(POS) systems are vital to running a successful business today. Small bars typically benefit from cloud-based POS software offered on a month-to-month basis.

For these reasons, many cash registers systems are being dropped for the more modern POS systems. You can add products with details and image, but also manage multiple users, add customers, use gift cards, and more.

Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.
