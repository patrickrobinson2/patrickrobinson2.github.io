<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges. Most of you are familiar with point of sale (POS) systems, even if you don't realize it. Remote access: Some POS systems can act as bar and restaurant management software, allowing managers to view sales figures, stock data and much more, remotely. Whether you're serving drinks at happy hour, serving customers a quick meal or brewing up the latest imported coffee bean, eHopper is made for multiple types of small businesses.</p>

<p>In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. When deciding on a bar POS system, it's important to talk to a representative to find out if they have all the features you need, and what they will cost—often, the starter” or core” package does not include more sophisticated features like advanced reporting, the loyalty program, or granular inventory controls.</p>
