<p>Payment by check has historically offered an opportunity for fraud and lost revenues, but modern point of sale systems have introduced security tools to help minimize this possibility. Integrated employee time card systems schedule hours and generate payroll, and the inventory is intelligent and self-managing (set the items just one time and the inventory tracks and manages them from there on out, sending key alerts when items need to be reordered, and even printing order forms for vendors).</p>
<p>The components of a POS system include hardware, software and operational features. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors. POS software or POS systems are located wherever a transaction occurs, which generally tends to mean the terminal that is used for checkouts.</p>
