<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. Some packages are designed specifically for food and beverage service businesses, like TouchBistro and Toast. It can also mean that the system—software and cloud server—must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation. It has different modules for billing, database management, order token management, employee and staff management, and a lot more.</p>

Multi-store businesses, such as chains or franchises, will have access to the hierarchy feature, which allows businesses to easily manage and control simple to complex organisational business structures with accompanying access privileges. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.</p>
