<p>Over the last few years, there have been several advancements in restaurant POS Before we look at how the restaurant point of sale system has evolved over the years, let us first define what exactly is a point of sale system. As in other software industries, many POS vendors have cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) plans that you subscribe to. These tend to be the most affordable options. The cash only retail business is quickly fading into obscurity.</p>
<h2>Best POS For Small Retail Bellingham WA</h2>
