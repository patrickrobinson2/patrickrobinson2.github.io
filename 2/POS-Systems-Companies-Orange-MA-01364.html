<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. What Imonggo's free plan doesn't offer is broad integration capabilities, offline access, or the option to accept credit card payments. Once you've come up with a shortlist of potential POS systems, check out what businesses like yours are saying about them. With core functionalities built around inventory management, ecommerce, analytics, and customer loyalty, it helps you boost product management as well as track and organize customer data.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis.
