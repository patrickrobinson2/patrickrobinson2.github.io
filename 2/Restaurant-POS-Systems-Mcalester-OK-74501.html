<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores. This all-inclusive system is a platform for staff management, inventory control, back office management, reporting, and marketing. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>

If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>
<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>
