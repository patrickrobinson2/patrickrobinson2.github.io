<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up. Your point of sale should help you automate and optimize how you manage your business's inventory. Give your bartenders possibility to quickly and accurately serve customers and create a unique atmosphere for your bar. So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually.</p>
