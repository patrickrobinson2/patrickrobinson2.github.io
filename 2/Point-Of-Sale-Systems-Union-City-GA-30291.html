<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information. Managers can also keep track of profits, inventory, menu trends, and other analytics. And if you want to do business online as well as in person, some POS systems offer the ability to create an online store that will pull from the same inventory database as your brick-and-mortar store.</p>
<h2>A Point Of Sale System Designed To Make Selling Easy Union City</h2>
<p>Square's simple and affordable POS hardware and software let you take payments anywhere your customers can meet you.

UniCenta also provides customized interfaces for restaurants and retailers and the ability to operate in multiple languages and accept different currencies.</p>
<p>Aside from the POS system, it features customizable menu management. The software provides real-time insights into sales and other financial information, customer behavior, inventory, and more. Aside from an integrated magstripe reader for debit and credit card payment processing, Square also offers other functionalities such as inventory and sales tracking in real-time as well as item management. As you evaluate POS systems, you need to look at the costs, terms and features for each part of the system: software, hardware and payment processing.</p>
<p>For a small to medium business owner, you may want to consider choosing a POS system that allows you to completely track and manage your inventory and helps you get to know your customers and what they prefer so you will know when and how much to reorder. For credit card processing, businesses can choose ShopKeep Payments or any processor in the BridgePay gateway including First Data, Chase Paymentech, Vantiv and Heartland.</p>
