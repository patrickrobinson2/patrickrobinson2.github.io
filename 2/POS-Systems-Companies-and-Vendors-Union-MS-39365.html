<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Anything that helps you streamline staff management—and potentially lower labor costs—is a plus. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this. Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software. However, if the system does not run reliably, it can cause serious headaches for both management and wait staff.</p>
