<p>All the Point of Sale systems serves the purpose of keeping a close track of daily sales. Shopify POS is an iPad and iPhone-based point of sale application that allows you to manage your entire online and physical store business using a unified platform. Having these options is mostly a no-brainer these days because you have access to all your sales and programming data online remotely or through an App. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores.

Usually, this is an automated process which is scheduled to run at a certain time interval in real stores.</p>
<p>Now, customers can walk into a bar and grill having already placed their order before they left the office. You may think of point-of-sale (PoS) systems as just ordinary cash registers, but they're evolving to do much more. Chris Ligan, vice president of acquisitions at credit card processing company Auric , listed a few must-haves that every business, bar or otherwise, should look for in a POS system. Small businesses can take advantage of simple credit card processing, which is integrated with Quickbooks and encrypted for the protection of the business and its customers' data.</p>
