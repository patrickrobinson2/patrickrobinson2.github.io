Vend is EMV and NFC capable and integrates with Vantiv , PayPal , and Square for in-store credit card payments.

If you have a chain of restaurants across the world and looking for a restaurant POS software to streamline your business then you can take a look at our eZee Optimus restaurant POS system.</p>
