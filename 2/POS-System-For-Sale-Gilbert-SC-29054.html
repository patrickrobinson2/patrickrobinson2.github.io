<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets. In modern terms, a POS system is typically a POS software product installed on a touchscreen hardware device. Maitre'D POS by Posera is a POS software designed for quick service and full table service restaurants, nightclubs, and bars. The Revel Bar POS system is equipped with tools to help entrepreneurs maximize their bar business. Features allow restaurants to create table maps, easily update menu items and monitor sales in real time through the Upserve mobile app.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
