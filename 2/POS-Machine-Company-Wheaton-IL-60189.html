<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Lavu offers several features that allow customization of menu layouts, easier staff training, and quicker order taking. provides credit card processing services and equipment to retailers, restaurants and online merchants. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more. This article will discuss some of the retail POS systems that we routinely recommend over and over.</p>

<p>Also, manage multiple locations, and offers multi-user staff logins for security, time and tip tracking. Lavu POS systems centralize your data storage in a cloud-based system to give management complete control over the program.
