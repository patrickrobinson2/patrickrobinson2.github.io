<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? The PDT stores your inventory count which enables you to upload it quickly into your Point of Sale software. It offers a choice of month-to-month or annual subscription plans for its POS software, and all of its plans support an unlimited number of users, customers and products. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>

<h3>Best POS Systems For Bars Hampden Maine</h3>
<p>You have access to features like table management, delivery, and cash management. POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry. Entry level systems begin at around $500 for the hardware and a monthly subscription price for the software of about $50. The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management.</p>
<p>POS software in these cases handles special orders, purchase orders, repair orders, service and rental programs as well as typical point of sale functions. And cloud technology has paved the way for truly modern POS, enabling the rapid integration of critical systems to optimize customer experiences while simultaneously driving higher margins.

<p>Businesses can mitigate the cost of hardware by renting them monthly or buying refurbished terminals. This has a two-fold effect on efficiency by ensuring that your stock levels are always maintained at the appropriate levels, and by processing the customers payment quickly so they can take their purchase and leave. The intuitive and easy to use point of sale system works on mobile and desktop devices and being cloud-based, allows businesses to access key data whilst on the go.</p>
<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look. When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
